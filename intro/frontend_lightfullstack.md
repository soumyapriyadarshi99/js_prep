Hi My nmae is Soumya priyadarshi Das. I am belongs to Bhubaneswar, Odisha.
I have done my B.Tech in Electronics and communication Engineering and graduated in 2021.

Coming to my professional experience, I have around 3 years of experience as a software engineer.
from the past 1 year and 5 months I have been working for Recykal as a software Engineer.

Mostly I used to work on frontend side like Javascript, css, html, React, Redux and for application developmet
I have worked on React native.

In backend also I have worked on nodeJs, express, mysql and mongo DB.

currently we are doning one online platform for waste management. We do have some buyers and sellers. Basically buyers are the one
who used buy waste materials and convert to end user products. Sellers are the ones who used to sell waste materials in bulk.
We as a middleware currently automating the process through our internal portal and two applications like buyer app and seller app.
we have many features in this like creation of listing by sellers, requisitions by buyers, matching of requisitions and listings,buyer seller mapping, invoice creation, route definition, tracking trucks.

In this project, I have worked from the beginning of the development. So I have touched and worked on most of the modules. Some key components I can remember are creation of complete ui library for this. Like I was part of developing complete reusuable ui components as per our configuration. We can start from simple buttons, input fileds to complex components like accordion, stepper, progressbar and routin system also.
Apart from this I have worked on writting custom hooks for api calls, debouncing and many other tasks also. Even I was part of giving kt and grooming to junior developers and interns in React and Javascript.

So I was resposible for developing complete Role Based Access System for Marketplace product. We have different vertices in our team. Like marketing team, finance team, sales team. So in our app we are giving only specific and required role to specific group of people. So for this I created a wrapper with specfic permission and wrap the components which we need to give permission. It is limited to module, let suppose for a specific person also we wrote useAuthority hooks to give him separate permissions. So I think this is the toughest module till now which I worked. For this I had to understand complete product both from dev side and business side.
